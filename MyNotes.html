                  <h3>The World Wide Web</h3>
                  <div class="mytext">
                     The world wide web can be modeled using three
                     major pieces:
                     There is you and your browser, there is the internet and
                     there are servers. Whenever you want to access a webpage
                     your browser makes requests to a server via the internet
                     using a protocol called <em>http</em>. The server responds with
                     files that the browser displays on your computer.
                     Those files are coded in
                     <em>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</em>
                     among other languages. <em>Hyperlinks</em> allow you to move
                     from one webpage to another, thus making the whole thing weblike.
                     The number of webpages existing is somewhere on the order of 30
                     billion.

                    On this page we are going to focus on how web pages are coded.
                    One can basically think of a web page as a house, then there is
                    <ul>
                      <li>HTML, which describes the structure of the house, like "Where are the
                          walls?" or "Which room is the living room?",</li>
                      <li>CSS, which describes the style of the house, like "Are there any curtains?" or
                          "Which colour is that wall?",</li>
                      <li>Java Script, which describes the interactive elements, like "Open a door!",</li>
                      <li>rules, like "A TV cannot float in a room." and</li>
                      <li>tools, like "You need a hammer to build a wall."</li>
                    </ul>
                    This text is going to give an introduction to HTML and CSS as well as some brief
                    thoughts on how to learn a programming language.

            <div class="mytext">
              HTML files define the structure of a web page. This structure is tree like, meaning it
              is a structure that has branches. The <em>DOM - Document Object Model</em> is the convention for the
              browser for representing and interacting with elements in HTML. An element is the most
              basic structure in HTML and is represented through tags. Elements can be empty, contain text
              or contain other elements. Each tag has a type, which defines what kind of element will be created
              by the browser, e.g. a paragraph or an image. Tags can also have attributes describing them.
              In order to give your web page styles you will use a different language called CSS, which
              will be described later in the text.

                  <h3>HTML - Tags and Attributes</h3>
                  <div class="mytext">
                      An HTML <em>element</em> basically consists of tags and contents:
                      <div class="Stag">&lt; NAME &gt; <span class="Scontent">Contents</span> &lt; /NAME&gt;</div>
                      The first red part is called an <em>opening tag</em>,
                      the second one a <em>closing tag</em>. The contents
                      are inbetween the tags. However, there are tags that do not
                      contain any contents, these are called <em>void tags</em>.
                      <em>Void tags</em> do not have <em>closing tags</em> either. Some examples are
                      <ul>
                        <li><span class="Stag">&lt;b&gt; <span class="Scontent">Contents</span> &lt;/b&gt;</span> - <span class="Scontent">Contents</span> will be bold</li>
                        <li><span class="Stag">&lt;em&gt; <span class="Scontent">Contents</span> &lt;/em&gt;</span> - <span class="Scontent">Contents</span> will be in italics (emphasized)</li>
                        <li><span class="Stag">&lt;br&gt;</span> - creates a new line (This is an example of a void tag)</li>
                        <li><span class="Stag">&lt;em&gt; <span class="Scontent">Contents</span> &lt;/em&gt;</span> - <span class="Scontent">Contents</span> will be contained in one paragraph</li>
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                      Some tags have <em>attributes</em>:
                      <div class="Stag">&lt; TAG ATTR=&quot; value&quot; &gt; <span class="Scontent">Contents</span> &lt; /TAG&gt;</div>
                      Examples include
                      <ul>
                        <li><span class="Stag">&lt;a href=&quot;www.reddit.com&quot;&gt; <span class="Scontent">Contents</span> &lt;/a&gt;</span> - the <em>anchor-tag</em>, which is used for hyperlinks </li>
                        <li><span class="Stag">&lt;img src=&quot;url&quot; alt=&quot;text&quot;&gt; <span class="Scontent">Contents</span> &lt;/img&gt;</span> - the <em>image-tag</em>, which is used to for images,  <span class="Stag">&quot;text&quot;</span> is displayed in case of broken requests and is also useful for blind people </li>
                      </ul>

                  </div>
                </div>

                  <h3>Inline vs Block Tags</h3>
                  <div class="mytext">
                    Tags like <span class="Stag">&lt;b&gt;</span> , <span class="Stag">&lt;em&gt;</span> , <span class="Stag">&lt;img&gt;</span>  and <span class="Stag">&lt;br&gt;</span>  are called <em>inline</em>, which basically means that the contents if present stay within the same line.
                    <span class="Stag">&lt;p&gt;</span>  is an example of a <em>block tag</em>.  <em>Block tags</em> create some sort of an invisible box around the contents, there will be more detail on that later.

                  <h3>Container Elements</h3>
                  <div class="mytext">
                    <em>Container elements</em> are elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside them. Two of them are <span class="Stag">&lt;span&gt;<span class="Scontent">text</span>&lt;/span&gt;</span>, which is inline and
                       <span class="Stag">&lt;div&gt;<span class="Scontent">text</span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>, which is a block tag.
                  </div>
                </div>

                  <h3>Boxes and Grids</h3>
                  <div class="mytext">
                    The background of a web page is basicly a grid in which the elements are arranged as boxes, that can have
                    sub-boxes and so on. So the first box
                    is the web page itself. The <span class="Stag">&lt;div&gt;<span class="Scontent">text</span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
                    tag defines a box. As later you will want to add style to your boxes you have to label the boxes. That is where
                    the <em>class</em>- attribute comes in, e.g.
                    <span class="Stag">&lt;div class="something"&gt;<span class="Scontent">text</span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>.
                    Boxes can have several labels as they can belong to multiple classes.

                  <div class="mytext">
                    HTML-documents possess a certain kind of document structure which looks somewhat like this:
                    <div class="image"><img src="images/HTMLStruct.png" alt="Screenshot"></div>
                    The head contains metadata, whereas the body contains the actual contents. Up to now we have been focussing on the body only.

                    <h4>Whitespaces</h4>
                    In HTML all whitespaces or sequences of whitespaces turn into a single space.
                    <h4>Escape Codes</h4>
                    Sometimes in a text you will want to write something like &quot;&lt; b &gt;&quot; instead of of having those
                    characters be interpreted as HTML code. That is where <em>escape codes</em> come in. This example would
                    be written as &quot;&amp;lt; b &amp;gt;&quot;.

                    let you control how your web page is going to look through socalled <em>rules</em>. <em>Cascading</em>
                    means that you go down and down with all the rules for an element until you find the most
                    specific rule which then gets applied.

                  <div class="mytext">
                    There are several ways to add CSS to your HTML, this text will focus on linking the CSS-file
                    to your HTML document, which is achieved by adding a line like
                    <div class="image"><img src="images/CSSlink.png" alt="Screenshot"></div>
                    in the head-section of the HTML file.<br>
                    The CSS-file then looks something like this:
                    <div class="container">
                      <div class="image2"><img src="images/CSSEx.png" alt="Screenshot"></div>
                      <div class="mytext">
                        You select the element you want to add style to by using a socalled <em>selector</em>. This can
                        be an HTML-tag (e.g. a p-tag) or a class (e.g. sand). Then you assign <em>values</em> to <em>properties</em>
                        by writing <span class="Scontent"> property:value</span>.
                      </div>

                  <h3>The Box Revisited</h3>
                  <div class="mytext">
                    As mentioned above everything on a web page is a box.
                    <div class="container">
                      <div class="image2"><img src="images/BoxModel.png" alt="Screenshot"></div>
                      <div class="mytext">
                        A box consists of a <em>margin</em>, a <em>border</em>, a <em>padding</em> and the <em>content</em>, each
                        one containing the other. The <em>content</em> is the image or the text you want to be displayed. The <em>padding</em> clears out an area around the content and is affected
                        by the background color of the box. The <em>border</em> surrounds the padding and the <em>margin</em> clears up an area around the border, is essentially trasparent
                        and defines the space between the boxes.
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    By default the size of a box is calculated as "border+padding+content", but there is an easier
                    to use model available, which allows you to enter the size of the box that then stays fixed when tweaking the border and
                    the padding. You can use this model by setting <span class="Scontent"> box-sizing:border-box</span> in your CSS-file.
                    <div class="container">
                      <div class="mytext">As this option is fairly new you have to enter some browser specific prefixes, so here is what you have to type:

                      <div class="image3"><img src="images/BorderBox.png" alt="Screenshot"></div>
                    </div>
                    You can also choose whether you want to define the size of the box in pixels or as a percentage, the latter resulting
                    in the box being scaled when the browser is scaled. You can also set a maximum width (property <span class="Scontent">max-width</span>), so that
                    the box will resize and become smaller when neccesary but will not get larger than that number.

                  <div class="mytext">
                    As a block element a <span class="Stag">div</span>-box will by default use up the whole of the width of
                    the page. Adding the style <span class="Scontent">display:flex</span> will override this behaviour and let
                    you put several boxes on one line.

            <div class="mytext">
              Browsers such as Firefox or Chrome offer socalled <em>developer tools</em> to visualize
              the structure of a web page.
              <div class="container">
                <div class="image2"><img src="images/DevTools.png" alt="Screenshot"></div>

                  Sideways triangles symbolize elements and can be expanded to show the contents. Hovering over an
                  element with the mouse leads to the according part of the page being highlighted. You can also use those tools to display the styles of a page.

              Finally two useful links should be mentioned, which you can use to validate your HTML or CSS:<br>

                  <div class="mytext">
                    In spoken languages even grammatically correct sentences
                    can contain some sort of <em>ambiguity</em>. Humans usually
                    infer the correct meaning by looking at the context. In
                    contrast to humans computers interpret code literally.

                    In programming the key is to understand the big ideas.
                    It does not matter if you do not know each and every command,
                    instead it is important to understand the concepts and
                    to know where to find the things you need.

                  <div class="mytext">
                    In order to keep your code readable it is important to give
                    it a certain structure, this is where indenting comes in.
                    Remember, it is not only the machine that has
                    to &quot;understand&quot; your code, a colleage or maybe even
                    yourself half a year later might want to read your code too.

                  <div class="mytext">
                    The idea is to reuse code as you go along programming. I.e. you can use
                    the same style several times while only defining it once.

                  <h3>Some Thoughts on Learning</h3>
                  <div class="mytext">
                    One can model a learning process using four steps
                    <ul>
                      <li>Ignorance</li>
                      <li>Awareness</li>
                      <li>Ability</li>
                      <li>Fluency</li>
                    </ul>
                    While getting from ignorance to awareness and to ability takes
                    only a rather short time it can take ages to actually achieve
                    fluency.
